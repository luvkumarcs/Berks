            <h2>What is Sales Outstanding?</h2>
            <p>Sales outsourcing is the practice of hiring a third-party company to handle some or all of your sales
                activities. This can include tasks such as prospecting for new clients, making sales calls, negotiating
                deals, and managing customer relationships. Outsourcing sales can be a cost-effective way for a company
                to improve its sales performance and expand into new markets without having to invest in additional
                resources or hire new employees. Additionally, outsourcing sales can provide access to specialized
                knowledge and expertise that may not be available within the company. <br><br>

                When you work with SFI, we take responsibility for recruiting, hiring, training, and managing your sales
                team(s) and essentially work as your sales department and an extension of your company. We ensure that
                our sales professionals always present themselves as your brand to your customers. Many businesses
                outsource processes like payroll, human resources, and marketing; your sales processes are no different.
